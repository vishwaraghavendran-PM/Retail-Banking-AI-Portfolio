# Retail Banking CRM – Agentic AI Case Study

## 1. Business Context
Retail banks operate in an intensely competitive environment where customer retention, personalized engagement, and operational efficiency determine long-term value. Legacy CRM systems rely heavily on manual processes, limited customer segmentation, and rule-based decision engines that struggle to adapt to rapidly changing customer behavior.

## 2. Problem Statement
Relationship managers lack:
- A unified, real-time understanding of customer portfolios  
- Proactive insights for churn risk or product fit  
- Automated follow-up actions that reduce manual effort  
- A scalable system to personalize offers at the customer level  

The result is fragmented engagement, inconsistent customer experience, and missed revenue opportunities.

## 3. Proposed Solution
Introduce an **Agentic AI CRM System** powered by Azure AI Foundry + Azure OpenAI + Cosmos DB that:
- Analyzes customer portfolios using LLM-based reasoning  
- Predicts churn risk and identifies cross-sell opportunities  
- Performs compliance checks on generated recommendations  
- Automates CTAs such as email drafts or task creation  
- Logs actions for auditability and model evaluation  

## 4. Value Proposition
- 40–60% faster portfolio analysis  
- Automated, compliant recommendations delivered in seconds  
- Reduction in manual CRM tasks  
- Personalized experiences that drive cross-sell and retention  
- Audit trail that supports governance and transparency  

## 5. Demo Scope (MVP)
- Single customer portfolio analysis  
- Generation of product recommendations  
- Churn risk explanation  
- Compliance agent validation  
- Activity logging in Cosmos DB
